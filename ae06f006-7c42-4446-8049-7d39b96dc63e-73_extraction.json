Biochemical, immunologic, and molecular tests of body fluids provide additional detail to the overall phenotype. Importantly, these objective laboratory tests together with functional studies compose an assessment of the endophenotype (or endotype) of an individual, refin -\ning the overall discriminant power of the evaluation. One additional concept that has gained traction in recent years is the notion of orthogonal phenotyping, i.e., assessing clin -\nical, molecular, imaging, or functional (endo)phenotypes seemingly unrelated to the clinical presentation. These features further enhance the ability to distinguish (sub)phenotypes and derive from the fact that diseases can be subtly (subclinically) manifest in organ systems different from that in which the primary symptoms or signs are expressed. While some diseases are well known to affect multiple organ systems (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) and in many cases involvement of those many systems is assessed at initial diagnosis, such is not the case for most other diseases. As we begin to understand the differ -\nences in the organ-specific expression of genomic variants that drive or modify disease, it is becoming increasingly apparent that orthogonal—or more appropriately, unbiased  \ncomprehensive—phenotyping should become the norm.\nGenomic profiling must next be coupled to detailed \nphenotyping. The complex levels of genomic assess -\nment continue to mature and include DNA sequencing (exomic, whole genome), gene expression (mRNA and protein expression), and metabolomics. In addition, the epigenome, the posttranslationally modified proteome, and the metagenome (the personal microbiome of an individual) are gaining traction as additional elements of comprehensive genomics (Chap. 483) . Not all of these \ngenomic features are yet available for clinical laboratory testing, and those that are available are largely confined to blood testing. While DNA sequencing using whole blood would generally apply to any organ-based disease, \nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   32 19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPotential captions/headings: Integration:; Loscalzo:",
